Abrupt climate change, tipping points in the climate system: Climate change could result in global, large-scale changes.
People who regard climate change as catastrophic, irreversible or rapid might label climate change as a climate crisis or a climate emergency.
[needs update] While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, if black carbon in soot falls on snow or ice, it can also increase global warming.
Mitigation of climate change is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or the enhancement of the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
Long-term effects of global warming: On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
Examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost, which would lead to amplified global warming.
Possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, and possible future climate engineering.
Every country in the world is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change.
Additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, what the consequences of global warming will be, and what to do about it.
Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are two complementary responses to global warming.
